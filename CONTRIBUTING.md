Why this policy exists

- The repository is a design/prototype archive and the owner prefers to keep the repository stable and unchanged.
- To ensure clarity and legal consistency, the project is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license — which gives broad rights to fork and reuse, but the maintainers have chosen not to accept upstream contributions into this repository.

- You are free to reuse code according to the Apache-2.0 license in your own project or fork.
